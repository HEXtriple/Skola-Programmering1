# Level 1:  Extend this program so that it generates a list of symbols, prints the symbols and then calculates and prints the winnings.
# Level 2:  Introduce a bank that keeps track of the users winnings. Print the current amount in the bank after each round.
# Level 3:  Let the user bet an amount from the bank each round. Verify that the user is not betting more than what is currently in the bank.
#           Multiply the winnings by the bet.
